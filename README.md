## Skygazer

This very simple mod lets players do what humans in the wilderness have been able to do without tools since time immemorial; look at the sky and determine what time of the day it is and what direction they're facing.

It adds a text-based HUD that tells the player how long remains until the next dawn or sunset, and what compass direction they're facing. When a player goes out of sight of the sky for an extended period this HUD disappears.
